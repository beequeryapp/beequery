# Performance Considerations

## Desktop App Performance

-   Implement virtual scrolling for large result sets
-   Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
-   Lazy load components and features
-   Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports

## Database Operations

-   Implement query result streaming for large datasets
-   Use connection pooling for better performance
-   Cache frequently accessed metadata
-   Implement query optimization suggestions

## React Optimization

-   Use React.memo for components that re-render frequently
-   Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive operations
-   Avoid creating objects/functions in render
-   Use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks

## Bundle Optimization

-   Use dynamic imports for code splitting
-   Implement lazy loading for routes and components
-   Optimize images and assets
-   Remove unused dependencies and code
