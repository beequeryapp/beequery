# BeeQuery Project Overview

BeeQuery is an open-source database management tool and TablePlus alternative built with modern web
technologies. It provides a beautiful, intuitive interface for connecting to and managing all major
database providers including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis, and more. The project
consists of a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri and a companion website built with
Next.js.

## Monorepo Structure

-   **apps/desktop/**: Tauri-based desktop application (React + TypeScript + Vite)
-   **apps/website/**: Next.js website for landing page, documentation, and web features
-   **Package Manager**: Bun (primary package manager for all workspaces)

## Tech Stack

-   **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features
-   **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
-   **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first CSS framework
-   **shadcn/ui**: Component library for consistent UI
-   **Lucide React**: Icon library
-   **Radix UI**: Headless UI primitives
-   **Tauri 2**: Rust-based desktop framework
-   **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router

Remember: BeeQuery aims to be the go-to open-source alternative to TablePlus, focusing on ease of
use, performance, and comprehensive database support.
