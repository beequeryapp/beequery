# Monorepo Development Workflow

## Package Manager

- **Bun**: Primary package manager for all workspaces
- Use `bun install` for dependency management
- Leverage Bun's workspace features

## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Run both apps
bun run dev:desktop      # Desktop app only
bun run dev:website      # Website only

# Building
bun run build            # Build both apps
bun run build:desktop    # Desktop app only
bun run build:website    # Website only

# Wails specific
wails dev               # Wails development mode
wails build             # Build desktop app

# Installation
bun run install:all      # Install all workspace dependencies

# UI Components
bun run ui:add:web <component-name>     # Add a new component to the website
bun run ui:add:desk <component-name>    # Add a new component to the desktop app
```

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Create feature branches from main
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Workspace Management

- Each app has its own package.json and dependencies
- Shared dependencies should be managed at the root level
- Use workspace: protocol for internal package references
